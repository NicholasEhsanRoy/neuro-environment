# neuro-environment
The point of this project was to learn how to use existing cloud-based neuroscience morphology datasets and tools to get morphologically accurate mesh files of neuropil volumes, so I could use them as an environment for microbot simulations in brain tissue. The project was finished on 15/08/2023.

The tools eventually found to be useful where,

Cloud-Volume

Neuroglancer (for visualising the large datasets, and getting my head around them and their coordinate system)

pyvista

trimesh

numpy

tqdm

The final mesh acquired (at low resolution due to space constraints), was neuropil_1.obj.
